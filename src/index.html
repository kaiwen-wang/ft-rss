            General thoughts on news:
        </h2>
        <article class="prose font-serif">

            <p>
                Staying informed yet not getting distracted is important. I know that 90% of the news is garbage, but I
                still find it necessary to roughly know what's going on. For some people, maybe they can browse it once
                in the morning and let it be. If I look at the front page, I'll inevitably end up scrolling around due
                to the big pictures and headlines. Getting only the most read stories is a good alternative.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my view, a Bloomberg Terminal-like interface is optimal. Focusing your attention is a core part of
                succeeding in the modern economy. That's why I use a RSS reader and curate my sources from informative
                blogs, personal websites, substacks, legal news, and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
                There aren't any other newspapers I find interesting or relevant. Sources like La Tribune, Süddeutsche
                Zeitung, and
                Straits Times seem too regional. Similar to the FT include the WSJ,
                Economist, and
                Bloomberg, but they don't quite seem the same quality. The headlines hit lacklustrely, but lately the FT
                has been like that as well, especially for geopolitical concerns and how they turn off comments. We'll
                wait and see.

            </p>

            <p>
                I feel like the most read on Nikkei Asia and Zhihu may bring in interesting new perspectives, and they
                would be the target of my next RSS Most Read project.

    <!-- 
            <p>
                There's a small issue where my RSS reader (NetNewsWire) replaces only adds a new article if it sees a
                new rss.xml.
                I need to find a way where it includes all the past posts in the current rss.xml. Othewise if I don't
                open the RSS reader for a
                few days, I miss the previous stories.

                Simultaneously, I don't want any new user who uses the tool to be spammed with 1000 old stories. So I'm
                not sure what the best answer is there.
